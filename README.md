There are several experiments I had performed on data sets to learn while doing these projects

1. Airbnb (hyper parameter k optimization) learning: right feature selection or feature engineering is important

2.NBA congress(Generally political views are divided into left_wing and right_wing(https://www.diffen.com/difference/Left_Wing_vs_Right_Wing)Thus I am trying to predict how inclined the view of a politician is here in this project.
